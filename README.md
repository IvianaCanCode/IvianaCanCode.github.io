Welcome to my first ever completed website. I did this during the SIP Program at Girls Who Code.
My project is about advocating to support Anime Animators in Japan because majority of them are overworked and receive low pay. Its affecting the people around them and of course their well being.
So doing contributing in like donating or sharing would help!.
