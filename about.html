  <h1 id="creator">Meet The Creator!</h1>

  <p id="blurbOfme">Hello! My name is Iviana Foster and I created this project during the Summer Immersion Program at Girls Who Code. I choose this cause because I am a artist and an individual who watched anime since I was a baby, so knowing there's a inequality in the Anime Industry shocked me and inspired me create this. Also knowing that the Anime Industry made over 2.5112 trillion yen (around $24.08 billion) in 2019, but Anime animators are being paid little to nothing is astonishing.</p>
